## How did we get here?

* 2005 A letter to the European Commission from 6 Heads of State (from France, Poland, Germany, Italy, Spain and Hungary) suggests the creation of a European digital library. The EC publishes its i2010 strategy on digital libraries.
* 2007 The European Digital Library Network - EDLnet - begins to create a prototype, funded by i2010.
* 2008 Europeana's prototype is launched on 20 November by Viviane Reding, European Commissioner for Information Society and Media, and the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso. Read the Council of the EU’s conclusions about Europeana released the same day.
* 2009 Europeana's collection reaches 5 million items.
* 2010 A European Parliament report approved in February asks for more content and funding for Europeana. It is unanimously approved. In July, Europeana's collection reaches 10 million items. The prototype becomes an operational service funded under the EC’s Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP ICT-PSP).
* 2011 The New Renaissance Report (May 2011) by the Comité des Sages endorses Europeana as ‘the reference point for European culture online’. In October, the EC releases recommendations asking EU Member States to step up their efforts to contribute to Europeana.
* 2012 Europeana releases all metadata under a CC0 waiver, making it freely available for re-use. Europeana’s collection reaches 25 million items.
* 2013 Europeana continues to further its position as a catalyst for innovation and digital enterprise in support of the Digital Agenda for Europe - one of the pillars of the EU’s Europe 2020 strategy.
