#Who We Are

Europeana is a catalyst for change in the world of cultural heritage.

**Our mission**: The Europeana Foundation and its [Network](http://europeana.eu/) create new ways for people to engage with their cultural history, whether it's for work, learning or pleasure.

**Our vision**: We believe in making cultural heritage openly accessible in a digital way, to promote the exchange of ideas and information. This helps us all to understand our cultural diversity better and contributes to a thriving knowledge economy.

The [Europeana Foundation](http://europeana.eu) is the operator of the Europeana service, including the search portal at Europeana.eu and related data services such as the Europeana Application Programming Interface (API) and the Linked Open Data pilot. The Foundation is governed by an Executive Committee and Board, and employs full-time and part-time staff.

The [Europeana Network](http://europeana.eu) is an open, expert forum comprising content holders and aggregators along with providers of technical, legal and strategic knowledge.

Our services are under constant development by content and technology projects, collectively referred to as the Europeana project group.

**What We Do**

- Aggregate – We are building the open, trusted source for European cultural content
Facilitate – We support the cultural heritage sector through knowledge transfer, innovation and advocacy
- Distribute – We make heritage available to people wherever they are, whenever they want it
- Engage – We cultivate new ways for people to participate in their cultural heritage
