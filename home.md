## Welcome to Europeana Professional, where librarians, curators and archivists share digital expertise. ##

> Europeana is a record of Europe’s journey. Through it, people can discover text, image and audiovisual material, regardless of the country or institution it is held in. All that Europe has considered worthy of keeping, of understanding, of studying -- a vast resource of organised and trustworthy knowledge -- has the potential to become accessible through Europeana.

> -- Jill Cousins, Director
